    <h1>What's Ajax?</h1>
    <p class="article">
        AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to
        communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, 
        and text files. AJAXâ€™s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can 
        communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page. <br> <br>
        
        The two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following: <br> <br>
        
        1. Make requests to the server without reloading the page <br>
        2. Receive and work with data from the server <br> <br>
